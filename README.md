## Introduction

Our mission is to add a user experience (UX) that has the capability to onboard masses. With "Blessed", we've crafted a solution that is intuitive, effective, and visually captivating. We considered the challenges users face when waiting in virtual queues for oversubscribed events. Our goal was to make this process more engaging and enjoyable while ensuring a fair and transparent distribution model for such events. Our solution strikes for the perfect balance, transforming waiting times into enjoyable experiences while making ticketing fair und transparent.

## Our UX Challenges

We face various UX challenges.
On the one hand we needed to think about the ticketing problem.

How can we make the frustrating process of buying into an oversubcribed event enyoable again?
How can we activate our future event attendees?
How can the process be fairer?

On the other hand we needed to think about the infrasstructure we use.

How can we use Gelato.networks RaaS, their middleware as VRF, relayer and their thirdparty integrations as Thirdweb to be as onboarding friendly as a new infrastructure need to be to get masses to use them and try to minimilize technical restrictions for normies.

- Step I - Wallet creation by Thirdweb - means any user can create a wallet in the back by using his mail, google account and also Apple ID. Any crypto native can sign in with tehri existing wallet. We did not design the Login UI as we used the free for the hackathon UI from Thirdweb for that. 
- Step II - Paying Gas to do any form of transaction is the next UX challenge to onboard non crypto natives. Here we used Gelatos Relayer option and Thirdwebs account abstraction. 
- Step III - Bundling transactions - as we create various contracts per event they needed to be deployed by the creator of the event. We used OpenZepplins Clone function to bundle these into a single transaction, that is executed now when the event creator clicks the create event button.
